# A text-mode game of hangman for one player

The game picks a random word from a word list, then the user gets
seven tries to guess letters in the word.
At anytime, the player can try to guess the whole word instead of
a letter.

The word list was downloaded 2024-11-03 from
[GitHub.com/Tom25/Hangman](https://github.com/Tom25/Hangman/blob/master/wordlist.txt)
Note: had to remove the word "quit" and the one hyphenated word "cross-bun"
from the list!

The game also displays guessed letters.
